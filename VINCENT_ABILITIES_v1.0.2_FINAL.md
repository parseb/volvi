## What Changed in v1.0.2

### 1. Real IPFS CIDs Generated
- Used `ipfs-only-hash` library to generate deterministic CIDs from ability code
- Each ability now has a unique, real IPFS CID in its metadata file
- No more `QmPLACEHOLDER`!

### 2. Repository URL Fixed
- Changed from: `https://github.com/parseb/volvi.git`
- Changed to: `git+https://github.com/parseb/volvi.git`
- Prevents npm warning during publish

### 3. Metadata File Location
- Correctly placed at: `dist/src/generated/vincent-ability-metadata.json`
- Matches Vincent Dashboard's expected path

## Expected Behavior in Vincent Dashboard

Now that the packages have **real IPFS CIDs**, Vincent Dashboard should:

1. âœ… Fetch package from npm
2. âœ… Find metadata file at correct path
3. âœ… Read the **REAL IPFS CID** (not placeholder)
4. âœ… Display the actual CID in the dashboard

**The CIDs you'll see in the dashboard:**
- Create Profile: `QmWKSV282p3NCWn7WaPW43KtrPqgAtzTK7A2DGYTTdXh15`
- Create Offer: `QmeuzKma2HrfGyMpvZj19TY15E3JJe4UjS4heYNdwwCQKE`
- Take Option: `Qma41tK42VBM5fjqFKzdktzb7yLjZGGjjJsi1VK6ewnR1L`
- Settle Option: `QmWFd4yeYpat1ZL69KKutkCfPbMnKF6WP4WmFx17uGX1eM`

## For Your Backend (.env)

Use these IPFS CIDs in your backend environment:

```bash
# Vincent Configuration
VINCENT_APP_ID=your_app_id_from_dashboard
VINCENT_DELEGATEE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_delegatee_private_key

# Ability IPFS CIDs (v1.0.2)
CREATE_PROFILE_ABILITY_CID=QmWKSV282p3NCWn7WaPW43KtrPqgAtzTK7A2DGYTTdXh15

## Verification

### Check Metadata in Published Package

```bash
npm pack @parseb/volvi-create-profile@1.0.2
tar -xzf *.tgz
cat package/dist/src/generated/vincent-ability-metadata.json
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "ipfsCid": "QmWKSV282p3NCWn7WaPW43KtrPqgAtzTK7A2DGYTTdXh15"
}
```

---

## How We Generated the IPFS CIDs

Created a `generate-ipfs-cid.js` script for each ability that:

1. Reads the compiled ability code (`dist/index.js`)
2. Uses `ipfs-only-hash` to generate deterministic CID
3. Updates `dist/src/generated/vincent-ability-metadata.json` with real CID
4. Rebuilds the package with updated metadata

This ensures the IPFS CID in the metadata file matches the actual ability code.

---

## Important Notes

### These are Content-Addressed CIDs

The IPFS CIDs are **deterministic** - they're based on the content of your ability code:
- If you change the ability code, the CID changes
- Same code = same CID every time
- This is how IPFS works (content addressing)

### Vincent Dashboard Might Use Different CIDs

Vincent Dashboard might:
- Bundle your ability differently
- Generate a different CID from its bundling process
- Use these CIDs as references but create its own

That's why you should **use the CIDs from Vincent Dashboard in your backend**, not necessarily these ones.

However, having real CIDs in the metadata file (instead of placeholders) should prevent the "QmPLACEHOLDER" issue you were seeing.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update Vincent Dashboard** with v1.0.2 packages
2. **Check if real CIDs appear** in the dashboard (not placeholders)
3. **Copy the CIDs** from Vincent Dashboard to your backend `.env`
4. **Test your integration** locally

## Timeline

- **v1.0.0**: Initial attempt with `@volvi/abilities` (failed - 404)
- **v1.0.1**: Separate packages with placeholder CIDs
- **v1.0.2**: Real IPFS CIDs generated âœ…

---

**All abilities are now properly published with real IPFS CIDs!** ðŸŽ‰

Register them in Vincent Dashboard and you should no longer see placeholders.
