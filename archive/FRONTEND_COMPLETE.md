## 🎯 User Flows

### Flow 1: Taking an Option
1. User visits landing page
2. Connects wallet via Reown AppKit
3. Selects token from dropdown (WETH/WBTC/USDC)
4. Browses orderbook, filters by type/duration
5. Clicks "Take" on an offer
6. TakerSidebar opens with offer details
7. User sets fill amount and duration
8. Premium is calculated in real-time
9. User approves USDC (if needed)
10. User executes option (on-chain transaction)
11. Option NFT is minted to user
12. Position appears in portfolio

### Flow 2: Writing an Option
1. User clicks "Write Options" tab
2. WriterSidebar opens
3. User fills form:
   - Option type (Call/Put)
   - Underlying token address
   - Collateral amount
   - Premium per day
   - Duration range
   - Min fill amount
   - Deadline
4. User approves token spending (separate transaction)
5. User submits form
6. Wallet prompts for EIP-712 signature
7. Offer is submitted to backend
8. Offer appears in orderbook
9. Collateral is locked when someone takes it

### Flow 3: Managing Positions
1. User visits portfolio page
2. Sees all positions with stats:
   - Total positions
   - Active positions
   - Total P&L
3. Filters by status (All/Active/Expired)
4. Views each position card:
   - Token ID
   - Type (Call/Put)
   - Collateral
   - Strike price
   - Current price
   - P&L
5. For expired options, clicks "Settle"
6. On-chain settlement executes
7. Profit is transferred or collateral returned

## 🔗 Integration with Backend

The frontend integrates with the backend API via `lib/api.ts`:

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/orderbook/:token` - Fetch orderbook
- `POST /api/offers` - Submit signed offer
- `GET /api/positions/:address` - Fetch user positions
- `GET /api/config/:token` - Fetch token config
- `GET /api/options/:tokenId` - Fetch option details

### Real-time Updates
- Orderbook refreshes every 10 seconds
- Positions refresh every 15 seconds
- Backend listens to contract events:
  - `OrderBroadcast` - New offers
  - `OptionTaken` - Partial fills
  - `OptionSettled` - Settlements

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Dark Mode Support
- Automatically detects system preference
- Tailwind dark mode classes throughout
- Readable in both light and dark themes

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Grid-based position cards
- Collapsible sidebars on mobile (future enhancement)

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for data fetching
- Transaction pending states
- Success/error feedback

### Validation
