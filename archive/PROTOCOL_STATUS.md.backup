## ⚠️ **MISSING / INCOMPLETE FEATURES**

### Backend - CoW Settlement Endpoints (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

The frontend SettlementDialog is ready, but these backend endpoints don't exist yet:

- ❌ `POST /api/settlement/initiate` - Create CoW order and call contract
- ❌ `POST /api/settlement/approve` - Store taker approval signature
- ❌ `POST /api/settlement/submit` - Submit order to CoW API

**Impact:** Users cannot currently settle options via CoW Protocol gasless mechanism. They would need manual settlement instead.

**Estimated Work:** 4-6 hours to implement these endpoints with proper CoW API integration.

---

### Backend - Persistent Storage (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

Currently using in-memory storage which resets on restart:

- ❌ Database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- ❌ Persistent offer storage
- ❌ Persistent position tracking
- ❌ Transaction history

**Impact:** All offers and positions are lost when backend restarts.

**Estimated Work:** 1-2 days to add database layer with migrations.

---

### Smart Contracts - Additional Features (OPTIONAL)

These are nice-to-have but not critical:

- ❌ American-style options (exercise before expiry)
- ❌ Automatic exercise for deep ITM options
- ❌ Options Greeks calculations (delta, gamma, theta)
- ❌ Limit order matching engine on-chain
- ❌ Liquidation mechanism for underwater positions

**Impact:** Protocol works fine without these advanced features.

---

### Frontend - Advanced Features (OPTIONAL)

- ❌ Charts for price history
- ❌ Options chain view (by strike/expiry)
- ❌ Portfolio analytics dashboard
- ❌ Transaction history table
- ❌ Advanced filtering (by moneyness, IV, etc.)
- ❌ Mobile responsive optimization

**Impact:** Current UI is functional but could be more feature-rich.

---

### Testing & Monitoring (INCOMPLETE)

- ❌ Comprehensive frontend unit tests
- ❌ E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
- ❌ Smart contract fuzzing tests
- ❌ Load testing for backend API
- ❌ Monitoring/alerting system
- ❌ Analytics tracking

**Impact:** Production readiness is lower without extensive testing.

---

## 🔍 **PROTOCOL COMPLETENESS ASSESSMENT**

- ✅ Multi-chain support from day one

**Gaps:**
- Backend CoW settlement endpoints (small gap, easy fix)
- Persistent storage (important for production)
- Testing coverage (critical for production)
- Security audit (mandatory for production)

**Verdict:**
- **95% ready for demo/testing** 🎉
- **70% ready for production** 📊
