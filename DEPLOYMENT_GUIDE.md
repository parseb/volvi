Quick reference for deploying the Options Protocol to Base.

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Get Required Accounts/Keys
- [ ] Reown Project ID: https://cloud.reown.com
- [ ] Base RPC URL (Alchemy/Infura)
- [ ] Deployer wallet with ETH on Base
- [ ] Broadcaster wallet (can be same as deployer)

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env` in project root:

```bash
# Blockchain
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
CHAIN_ID=8453

# Contract Addresses (Base Mainnet)

```

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy to Base Sepolia (Testnet)

```bash
# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests to ensure everything works
forge test -vv

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify

# Save the deployed contract address
export PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Link to project
railway link

# Add environment variables via Railway dashboard or CLI
railway variables set BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=$PROTOCOL_ADDRESS
railway variables set BROADCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_key
# ... add all backend env vars

# Deploy backend
cd backend
railway up

# Note the backend URL for frontend config
export BACKEND_URL=<your-backend-url.railway.app>
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Railway/Vercel

#### Option A: Railway

```bash
# In root directory
cd frontend

# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Frontend will be available at your Railway URL
```

#### Option B: Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test on Sepolia

1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Connect wallet to Base Sepolia
3. Get testnet ETH from faucet
4. Test writing an option:
   - Fill out form
   - Sign EIP-712 message
   - Submit offer
5. Test taking an option:
   - Select offer from orderbook
   - Set fill amount and duration
   - Execute transaction
6. Check portfolio for position
7. Test settlement (wait for expiry or use time travel in testing)

### Step 5: Deploy to Base Mainnet (Production)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Only after successful testing and audit!**

```bash
# Deploy contracts to Base mainnet
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --slow

# Update environment variables with mainnet contract address
# - Backend: NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS
# - Frontend: NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS

# Redeploy backend with new env vars
cd backend
railway up

# Redeploy frontend with new env vars
cd frontend
railway up  # or vercel --prod
```

## üîß Configuration Tasks

### Configure Token Settings

After deployment, configure supported tokens:

```bash
# Using cast (Foundry)
export PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=<your_contract_address>

# Configure WETH
cast send $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  "setTokenConfig(address,address,address,uint24,uint256,uint256,address)" \
  $WETH_ADDRESS \                    # underlying
  $USDC_ADDRESS \                    # stablecoin
  $UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER \              # swapVenue
  3000 \                             # poolFee (0.3%)
  1000000000000000000 \             # minUnit (1.0 token)
  1000000 \                          # minPremium (1 USDC)
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \  # hook
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY

# Configure WBTC
cast send $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  "setTokenConfig(address,address,address,uint24,uint256,uint256,address)" \
  $WBTC_ADDRESS \
  $USDC_ADDRESS \
  $UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER \
  3000 \
  100000000 \                        # minUnit (0.001 BTC)
  1000000 \
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Grant Broadcaster Role

```bash
# Get broadcaster role hash
BROADCASTER_ROLE=$(cast keccak "BROADCASTER_ROLE")

# Grant role to backend service
cast send $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  "grantRole(bytes32,address)" \
  $BROADCASTER_ROLE \
  $BROADCASTER_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Verification

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check contract is deployed
cast code $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL

# Check contract owner
cast call $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS "owner()" --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL

# Check broadcaster has role
cast call $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  "hasRole(bytes32,address)" \
  $BROADCASTER_ROLE \
  $BROADCASTER_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL

# Check WETH config
cast call $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  "getTokenConfig(address)" \
  $WETH_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL
```

### Monitor Events

```bash
# Watch for OrderBroadcast events
cast logs \
  --address $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  --from-block latest \
  "OrderBroadcast(bytes32,bool)" \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL

# Watch for OptionTaken events
cast logs \
  --address $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS \
  --from-block latest \
  "OptionTaken(uint256,bytes32,address,uint256,uint256,uint64)" \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check backend health
curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/health

# Check orderbook
curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/orderbook/$WETH_ADDRESS

# Check frontend loads
curl https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Contract Deployment Fails

**Issue**: Deployment transaction fails
**Solutions**:
- Check deployer has enough ETH for gas
- Verify RPC URL is correct
- Check contract size isn't too large
- Enable via-ir in foundry.toml (already done)

### Backend Can't Connect to Contract

**Issue**: Backend errors when calling contract
**Solutions**:
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS is correct
- Check RPC URL is accessible
- Verify contract is deployed at address
- Check broadcaster private key is correct

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Issue**: API calls fail from frontend
**Solutions**:
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
- Check CORS is enabled in backend
- Verify backend is running and accessible
- Check Railway logs for errors

### Reown AppKit Won't Connect

**Issue**: Wallet connection fails
**Solutions**:
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID is correct
- Check project is active on cloud.reown.com
- Verify chain ID matches (8453 for Base)
- Check browser console for errors

### Transactions Fail

**Issue**: Taking/settling options fails
**Solutions**:
- Check user has approved USDC spending
- Verify user has enough USDC for premium
- Check offer isn't expired
- Verify fill amount is within min/max
- Check duration is within range
