## What Changed from Original Plan

**Original:** Attempted to publish as `@volvi/abilities`
**Problem:** The `@volvi` npm organization doesn't exist and would require creating one
**Solution:** Changed to `@parseb/volvi-abilities` using your personal npm scope

This is actually better because:
- No need to create/manage an npm organization
- Immediate publishing without additional setup
- Still maintains clear branding with "volvi-abilities" name
