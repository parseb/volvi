pnpm build
```

### 3. Publish to npm

**For First-Time Publishing:**

```bash
cd packages/abilities
npm publish --access public
```

**Notes:**
- Scoped packages (`@volvi/abilities`) are private by default, so use `--access public`
- If `@volvi` scope doesn't exist, you can either:
  - Create an npm organization named "volvi"
  - OR change package name to use your npm username: `@yourusername/volvi-abilities`

### 4. Verify Publication

After publishing, verify at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@volvi/abilities

Check that all subpath exports work:
```bash
npm view @volvi/abilities
```

---

## Alternative: Use Your npm Username

If you don't want to create the `@volvi` organization, update the package name:

### Edit `packages/abilities/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@your-npm-username/volvi-abilities",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  ...
}
```

Then publish:
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Then in Vincent Dashboard, use:
- `@your-npm-username/volvi-abilities/create-profile@1.0.0`
- `@your-npm-username/volvi-abilities/create-offer@1.0.0`
- etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Package name already exists
- Someone else owns `@volvi` scope
- Solution: Use your npm username instead

### Error: 403 Forbidden
- You don't have permission to publish to `@volvi` scope
- Solution: Create `@volvi` organization or use your username

### Error: Need to login
```bash
npm logout
npm login
```

### Check what will be published
```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

This shows exactly what files will be included in the npm package.
