# Phase 5 Plan: Ability Publishing & Production Deployment

**Status**: ðŸš§ In Planning
**Prerequisites**: Phases 1-4 Complete âœ…

## Overview

Phase 5 is the final phase of the Vincent integration, focusing on publishing abilities to IPFS, registering them in the Vincent Dashboard, deploying smart contracts, and preparing for production deployment.

## Goals

1. âœ… Publish all Lit Actions to IPFS
2. âœ… Register abilities in Vincent Dashboard
3. âœ… Deploy smart contracts to Base Sepolia (testnet)
4. âœ… Complete end-to-end testing
5. âœ… Production deployment setup

## Phase 5 Breakdown

### Step 1: Smart Contract Deployment

**Goal**: Deploy contracts to Base Sepolia testnet

#### Tasks:

1. **Prepare Deployment**
   - Review contract code in `src/`
   - Update deployment scripts in `script/`
   - Set up environment variables

2. **Deploy to Base Sepolia**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
   export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
   export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=...

   # Deploy
   cd src
   forge script script/DeployBaseSepolia.s.sol \
     --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
     --broadcast \
     --verify
   ```

3. **Note Contract Addresses**
   - OptionsProtocol address
   - OptionsProtocolGasless address
   - USDC address (Base Sepolia testnet)

4. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Update `packages/backend/.env`
   - Update `packages/frontend/.env`
   - Set `OPTIONS_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS`

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Contracts deployed to Base Sepolia
- âœ… Contracts verified on BaseScan
- âœ… Contract addresses documented

---

### Step 2: Publish Abilities to IPFS

**Goal**: Upload Lit Action code to IPFS and get CIDs

#### Tasks:

1. **Build Abilities**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @volvi/abilities build
   ```

2. **Publish to IPFS**

   Each ability's Lit Action needs to be uploaded to IPFS. The Lit Action code is bundled JavaScript that runs in the Lit Protocol's trusted execution environment.

   **Option A: Manual IPFS Upload**
   ```bash
   # Install IPFS CLI if needed
   # brew install ipfs (macOS)
   # or download from https://ipfs.io/

   # For each ability:
   ipfs add packages/abilities/dist/create-profile/litAction.js
   ipfs add packages/abilities/dist/create-offer/litAction.js
   ipfs add packages/abilities/dist/take-option/litAction.js
   ipfs add packages/abilities/dist/settle-option/litAction.js
   ```

   **Option B: Use Pinata or NFT.Storage**
   - Upload to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) or [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/)
   - Get IPFS CIDs for each Lit Action

3. **Document CIDs**

   Create a file to track all CIDs:

   ```json
   {
     "createProfile": "ipfs://Qm...",
     "createOffer": "ipfs://Qm...",
     "takeOption": "ipfs://Qm...",
     "settleOption": "ipfs://Qm..."
   }
   ```

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… All Lit Actions published to IPFS
- âœ… CIDs documented
- âœ… Files pinned (won't be garbage collected)

---

### Step 3: Register Vincent App

**Goal**: Create production Vincent App and register all abilities

#### Tasks:

1. **Create Vincent App**
   - Go to [Vincent Dashboard](https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai/)

   - Generate delegatee keys
   - **IMPORTANT**: Save the delegatee private key securely
   - Copy your App ID

2. **Register Abilities**

   For each ability, register in the Vincent Dashboard:

   **Create Profile Ability**
   - Name: Create Liquidity Profile
   - Description: Create a USDC liquidity profile for writing options
   - Lit Action CID: `ipfs://Qm...` (from Step 2)

   DELEGATEE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # From Step 3
   ALLOWED_AUDIENCE=https://volvi.app

   # Network Configuration
   CHAIN_ID=84532  # Base Sepolia
   RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
   OPTIONS_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=0x...  # From Step 1
