# Base Mainnet Deployment - Security First Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Target**: Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - READ CAREFULLY

---

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE

### Private Key Exposure

**THE PRIVATE KEY SHARED IN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IS NOW COMPROMISED.**

```
Key: 0xe9cc26bc179ca4303400a72a9d54ee1ff8af614a7811fc12ff5e235490b9ee4c
Status: ‚ùå COMPROMISED - DO NOT USE
Risk: HIGH - Anyone who saw the chat can access funds
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Before ANY deployment, you MUST:**

1. **Generate a NEW deployer private key**
2. **Transfer any funds FROM the exposed address TO the new address**
3. **Never use the exposed key for mainnet operations**

---

## üîê Step 1: Create NEW Secure Deployer Key

### Option A: Using MetaMask (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Open MetaMask
# 2. Click account menu ‚Üí "Add account or hardware wallet"
# 3. Click "Add a new account"
# 4. Name it "Volvi Mainnet Deployer"
# 5. Click the 3 dots ‚Üí Account details ‚Üí Export Private Key
# 6. Enter password and SECURELY SAVE the new key
```

### Option B: Using Cast (Command Line)

```bash
# Generate a new wallet
cast wallet new

# Output will show:
# Successfully created new keypair.
# Address:     0x...
# Private key: 0x...

# SAVE THIS PRIVATE KEY SECURELY!
```

### Option C: Using Hardware Wallet (Most Secure)

```bash
# Use Ledger or Trezor for maximum security
# Follow hardware wallet setup guide
# Hardware wallets keep keys offline
```

---

## üí∞ Step 2: Fund Your NEW Deployer Address

### Check Current Balance of Exposed Address

```bash
# Check the EXPOSED address (DO NOT USE FOR DEPLOYMENT)
EXPOSED_ADDRESS="0x..." # Fill from exposed private key
cast balance $EXPOSED_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# If it has funds, transfer them to your NEW address
```

### Fund New Deployer Address

**You need approximately 0.1 ETH on Base Mainnet for:**
- Deployment gas: ~0.03-0.05 ETH
- Safety buffer: ~0.05 ETH
- Total recommended: **0.1 ETH**

**Methods to get ETH on Base Mainnet:**

1. **Bridge from Ethereum Mainnet**
   - Visit: https://bridge.base.org/
   - Connect wallet
   - Bridge ETH from Ethereum to Base
   - Takes 5-10 minutes

2. **Buy directly on Base**
   - Use Coinbase (Base is built by Coinbase)
   - Buy USDC, swap to ETH on Base
   - Or bridge from other chains via LayerZero

3. **Transfer from Exchange**
   - Some exchanges support Base network withdrawals
   - Cheaper than bridging from L1

### Verify New Address is Funded

```bash
# Replace with YOUR NEW address
NEW_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS="0x..."

cast balance $NEW_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# Should show at least 0.1 ETH
```

---

## üîß Step 3: Update .env with NEW Key

```bash
# Open .env file
nano .env

# Update ONLY these variables:
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # YOUR NEW PRIVATE KEY (not the exposed one!)
BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASESCAN_API_KEY=... # Your BaseScan API key
```

### Verify .env Configuration

```bash
# Check that .env has correct format (without revealing keys)
grep -E "^DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=" .env >/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Deployer key set" || echo "‚ùå Missing deployer key"
grep -E "^BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL=" .env >/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ RPC URL set" || echo "‚ùå Missing RPC URL"
grep -E "^BASESCAN_API_KEY=" .env >/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ BaseScan API key set" || echo "‚ùå Missing API key"
```

---

## üß™ Step 4: DRY RUN (Simulation - No Real Deployment)

**ALWAYS test first without broadcasting!**

```bash
# Simulate deployment (does NOT actually deploy)
forge script script/DeployBaseMainnet.s.sol:DeployBaseMainnetScript \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  -vvvv

# Review output:
# ‚úÖ Deployer address matches your NEW address
# ‚úÖ Balance shows >= 0.1 ETH
# ‚úÖ No errors in simulation
# ‚úÖ Estimated gas cost is reasonable
```

### Expected Dry Run Output

```
=================================================
!!!    DEPLOYING TO BASE MAINNET    !!!
!!!    THIS USES REAL MONEY         !!!
=================================================
Deployer: 0x... (YOUR NEW ADDRESS)
Balance: 0.15 ETH (or more)
=================================================

Deploying OptionsProtocol...
[Simulation output...]

=================================================
üéâ SIMULATION COMPLETE!
=================================================
OptionsProtocol: 0x... (simulated address)
```

**If you see ANY errors, STOP and fix them before proceeding.**

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Verify Deployment

### Check on BaseScan

```bash
# Open in browser
PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=$(grep "BASE_MAINNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS" deployments/base-mainnet.txt | cut -d'=' -f2)
echo "https://basescan.org/address/$PROTOCOL_ADDRESS"

# Should show:
# ‚úÖ Contract deployed
# ‚úÖ Source code verified
# ‚úÖ Read/Write functions available
```

### Verify Contract is Functional

```bash
# Read contract using cast
PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=$(grep "BASE_MAINNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS" deployments/base-mainnet.txt | cut -d'=' -f2)

# Check USDC address
cast call $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS "usdc()(address)" --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# Should return: 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 (Base Mainnet USDC)

# Check Pyth address
cast call $PROTOCOL_ADDRESS "pyth()(address)" --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# Should return: 0x8250f4aF4B972684F7b336503E2D6dFeDeB1487a (Base Mainnet Pyth)
```
